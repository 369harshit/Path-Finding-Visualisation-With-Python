Path-Finding-Visualisation-with-Pygame
A path-finding visualisation program using Pygame

Features 

1. Pygame GUI
2. Placeable walls/obsticles in the gui
3. Placeable checkpoints for the pathfinding algorithm to follow
4. 4 different pathfind algorithms; Depth-first search, Breadth-first search, dijkstra and A*
5. Hotkeys to remove cirtain details from the gui
6. Adjustable speed of visualisation
7. Adjustable size of the grid by scrolling
   
Keybinds listed at the bottom of the readme

Depth-first Search
1. Rule of expansion - Expand most recently added node
2. Order of expansion - Up, Right, Down, Left
3. Doesn't give the shortest route most of the time
4. Acts like humans in perfect mazes and sometimes can be way faster than other algorithms

5. However even on the simplest mazes it can skip right past the end point

Breadth-first search
1. Rule of expansion - Expand least recently added node
2. Acts like a wide net that covers every node that is closest in order
3. Always finds optimal route, however can be quite slow in long range searches
