Features 

1. Pygame GUI
2. Placeable walls/obsticles in the gui

Depth-first Search
Rule of expansion - Expand most recently added node
Order of expansion - Up, Right, Down, Left
Doesn't give the shortest route most of the time
Acts like humans in perfect mazes and sometimes can be way faster than other algorithms
